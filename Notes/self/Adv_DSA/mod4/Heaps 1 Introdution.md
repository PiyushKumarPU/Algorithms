## Connecting the Ropes
    Problem Description:
        You can connect any two ropes together, there is a cost associated to connect them = sum of length of both ropes that we re connecting.
        Find min cost to connect all the ropes together.
    Input
        Give an array of length of ropes

## Heap Introduction
    A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
