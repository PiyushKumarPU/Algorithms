## Pair With given sum 1
    Problem Statement:
        Given a sorted array of integer A and an integer k, find any pair (i,j)
        such that A[i] + A[j] = k and (i != j).
        Note : TC should be O(N) and with constant space.
        Example:
            arr1 = {-5,-2,1,8,10,12,15}
            k = 11
            ans = (2,4)
## Pair With given sum 2
    Problem Statement:
        Given an sorted array of integer A without duplicates and an integer k,
        find all the pair such that A[i] + A[j] = k and (i != j).
        Note : TC should be O(N) and with constant space.
        Example:
            arr1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,8}
            k = 11
            ans = (2,4)
## Subarray with given sum
    Problem Statement:
## Container with most water
    Problem Statement:
