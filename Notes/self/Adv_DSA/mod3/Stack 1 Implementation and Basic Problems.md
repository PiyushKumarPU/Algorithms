## Stack Introduction
    A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.

    Stack follow LIFO(Last in first out strategies because we perform all the operations(pop and push) from same end)

### For more information on stack please refer below links:
[Intro to Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-stack-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)
[Stack Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))

## Operations on Stack
![Stack Operations](../../../images/StackOperations.gif?raw=true)

 * push --> Push data at the top of the stack.
 * pop --> Delete data from top of the stack.
 * peek --> Return data present at top of the element.
 * isEmpty --> Check whether stack is empty or not
 * size --> Returns size of the stack

 Note:- 
    Underlying datastructure of Stack in Java is array and it is child class of Vector and List.

    Return type of push, pop and peek depends upon language choosen.
