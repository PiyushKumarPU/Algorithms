## Remove and Add Linked List
#### Problem Description:
    Given two linked lists A and B of size N and M respectively and two integers C and D Remove linked list A's nodes from the Cth indexed node to Dth indexed node to based index and put linked list B in its place.
    O <= N ,M <= 10^5
    1 <= C,D <= N- 1

## Next Greater element
### Problem Description:
    Given an array A find next greater element for every element of array Next greater element of A[i] is first greater element on right side of A[i]. If no greater element consider it -1

## Alex and Treasures
### Problem Description:
    Given an array A of points where A[i] =  (xi, yi) represents a point on 4 plane and an integer B return B farthest points to the origin 0,0 Distance between 2 points sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
    1 <= A.size() <= 10^5
    -10^4 <= x,y <= 10^4
    1 <= B <= A.size()
