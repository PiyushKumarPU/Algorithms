## Factors or Count the factor
  **What is factor?**
    Any number **i** is the factor of **N** if and only if **N % i == 0**

    e.g.
    2 is the factor of 10 because 10 % 2 == 0

  Factors of **24** is **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24**  (Factor Count is 8)

  ```java
    // Brute force approach to count number of factor of number N
    function countFactor(N){
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
            if(N % i == 0) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

  ```

  > Note: Any online plateform allowed 1 sec to execute any of the test cases and it allows to execute $10^9$ instruction in 1 sec. Generally online plateform has machine capacity of 1GHZ.

| N | Iterations | Execution Time|
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| $10^8$ | $10^8$ | 1 sec |
| $10^9$ | $10^9$ | 10 sec|
| $10^{18}$ | $10^{18}$ |$10^{10}$ Sec --> same as **317 Years**

### Optimization of counting factors

 > Way to optimize exisitng solutions
   
```
if i * j == N then i and j are factors of N
j = N / i, i.e. i and N/i are factors of N

if i is one factor then N/i will be another factor of N
```

Lets take exmaple of N = 24 and N = 100

<span style="color:red">Example 1 for N = 24</span>
| N(For N = 24) | N/i
| --- | ---------
|1    | 24
|2    | 12
|3    | 8
|4    | 6     (After this N and N/i pair numbers are repating)
|6    | 4
|12    | 2
|24    | 1

<span style="color:red">Example 2 for N = 100</span>
| N(For N = 100) | N/i
| --- | ---------
|1    | 100
|2    | 50
|4    | 25
|5    | 20     
|10   | 10    (After this N and N/i pair numbers are repating)
|20   | 5
|25   | 4
|50   | 2
|100  | 1

>By looking at above calculation we can define below constraint

> ```i <= N/i  ==>  i^2 <= N  ==> i <= sqrt(N)```

> **basically i goes from [i,sqrt(N)]**

```java
// Optimized approach to count number of factor of number N
function countFactor(N){
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i * i <= N; i++){
        if(N % i == 0) {
            count += (i == (N/i)) ? 1 : 2;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

```

### Prime number
 **What is a prime number?** 
    
    Any number can be called as prime number if it has only two factor 1 and itself.
    1 is the exception here, it is neither prime nor composite
