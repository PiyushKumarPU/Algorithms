/*
Problem Description
    Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B and A as one sorted array and return it as an output.
    Note: A linear time complexity is expected and you should avoid use of any library function.

Problem Constraints
    -2×10^9 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2×10^9
    1 <= |A|, |B| <= 5×10^4

Input Format
    First Argument is a 1-D array representing  A.
    Second Argument is also a 1-D array representing B.

Output Format
    Return a 1-D vector which you got after merging A and B.

Example
    Input 1:
        A = [4, 7, 9]
        B = [2, 11, 19]
    Input 2:
        A = [1]
        B = [2]

Example
    Output 1:
        [2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 19]
    Output 2:
        [1, 2]

Example
    Explanation 1:
        Merging A and B produces the output as described above.
    Explanation 2:
         Merging A and B produces the output as described above.
