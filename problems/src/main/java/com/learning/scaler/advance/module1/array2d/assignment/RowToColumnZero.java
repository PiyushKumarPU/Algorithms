Problem Description
    You are given a 2D integer matrix A, make all the elements in a row or column zero if the A[i][j] = 0.
    Specifically, make entire ith row and jth column zero.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A.size() <= 10^3
    1 <= A[i].size() <= 10^3
    0 <= A[i][j] <= 10^3

Input Format
    First argument is a 2D integer matrix A.

Output Format
    Return a 2D matrix after doing required operations.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        [1,2,3,4]
        [5,6,7,0]
        [9,2,0,4]

    Example Output
    Output 1:
        [1,2,0,0]
        [0,0,0,0]
        [0,0,0,0]

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        A[2][4] = A[3][3] = 0, so make 2nd row, 3rd row, 3rd column and 4th column zero.
