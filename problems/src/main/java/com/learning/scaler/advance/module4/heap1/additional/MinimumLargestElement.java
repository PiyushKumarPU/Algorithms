Problem Description
    Given an array A of N numbers, you have to perform B operations. In each operation, you have to pick any one of the N elements and add the original value(value stored at the index before we did any operations) to its current value. You can choose any of the N elements in each operation.
    Perform B operations in such a way that the largest element of the modified array(after B operations) is minimized.
    Find the minimum possible largest element after B operations.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 10^6
    0 <= B <= 10^5
    -10^4 <= A[i] <= 10^4

Input Format
    The first argument is an integer array A.
    The second argument is an integer B.

Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the minimum possible largest element after B operations.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
         B = 3
    Input 2:
         A = [5, 1, 4, 2]
         B = 5

Example Output
    Output 1:
        4
    Output 2:
        5

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         Apply operation on element at index 0, the array would change to [2, 2, 3, 4]
         Apply operation on element at index 0, the array would change to [3, 2, 3, 4]
         Apply operation on element at index 0, the array would change to [4, 2, 3, 4]
         Minimum possible largest element after 3 operations is 4.
    Explanation 2:
         Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 2, 4, 2]
         Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 3, 4, 2]
         Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 4, 4, 2]
         Apply operation on element at index 1, the array would change to [5, 5, 4, 2]
         Apply operation on element at index 3, the array would change to [5, 5, 4, 4]
         Minimum possible largest element after 5 operations is 5.
