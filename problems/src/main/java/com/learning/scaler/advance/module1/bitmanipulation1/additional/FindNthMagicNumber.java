Problem Description
    Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.
    A magic number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a power of 5 or a sum of unique powers of 5.
    First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 5000

Input Format
    The only argument given is integer A.

Output Format
     Returns the Ath magic number.

Example
    Input 1:
         A = 3
    Input 2:
     A = 10

Example
    Output 1:
         30
    Output 2:
         650

Example
    Explanation 1:
         Magic Numbers in increasing order are [5, 25, 30, 125, 130, ...]
         3rd element in this is 30
    Explanation 2:
         In the sequence shown in explanation 1, 10th element will be 650.
