Problem Description
    You are given N towns (1 to N). All towns are connected via unique directed path as mentioned in the input.
    Given 2 towns find whether you can reach the first town from the second without repeating any edge.
    B C : query to find whether B is reachable from C.
    Input contains an integer array A of size N and 2 integers B and C ( 1 <= B, C <= N ).
    There exist a directed edge from A[i] to i+1 for every 1 <= i < N. Also, it's guaranteed that A[i] <= i for every 1 <= i < N.
    NOTE: Array A is 0-indexed. A[0] = 1 which you can ignore as it doesn't represent any edge.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 100000

Input Format
    First argument is vector A
    Second argument is integer B
    Third argument is integer C

Output Format
    Return 1 if reachable, 0 otherwise.

Example Input
    Input 1:
     A = [1, 1, 2]
     B = 1
     C = 2
    Input 2:
     A = [1, 1, 2]
     B = 2
     C = 1

Example Output
    Output 1:
     0
    Output 2:
     1

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
     Tree is 1--> 2--> 3 and hence 1 is not reachable from 2.
    Explanation 2:
     Tree is 1--> 2--> 3 and hence 2 is reachable from 1.
