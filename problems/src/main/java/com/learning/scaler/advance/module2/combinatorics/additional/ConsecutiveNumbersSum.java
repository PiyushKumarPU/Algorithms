    Return the number of ways it can be written as a sum of consecutive positive integers.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 10^9

Input Format
    The first and the only argument of input contains an integer, A.

Output Format
    Return an integer, representing the answer as described in the problem statement.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = 5
    Input 2:
         A = 15
