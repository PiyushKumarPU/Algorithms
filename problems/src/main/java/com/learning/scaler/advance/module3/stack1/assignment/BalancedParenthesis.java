Problem Description
    Given an expression string A, examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“,”}”, ”(“,”)”, ”[“,”]” are correct in A.
    Refer to the examples for more clarity.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= |A| <= 100

Input Format
    The first and the only argument of input contains the string A having the parenthesis sequence.

Output Format
    Return 0 if the parenthesis sequence is not balanced.
    Return 1 if the parenthesis sequence is balanced.

Example
    Input 1:
         A = {([])}
    Input 2:
         A = (){
    Input 3:
         A = ()[]

Example
    Output 1:
         1
    Output 2:
         0
    Output 3:
         1

Example Explanation
    You can clearly see that the first and third case contain valid parenthesis.
    In the second case, there is no closing bracket for {, thus the parenthesis sequence is invalid.
