Problem Description
    You have a string, denoted as A.
    To transform the string, you should perform the following operation repeatedly:
    Identify the first occurrence of consecutive identical pairs of characters within the string.
    Remove this pair of identical characters from the string.
    Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more consecutive identical pairs of characters.
    The final result will be the transformed string.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= |A| <= 100000

Input Format
    First and only argument is string A.

Output Format
    Return the final string.

Example
    Input 1:
         A = "abccbc"
    Input 2:
         A = "ab"

Example
    Output 1:
         "ac"
    Output 2:
         "ab"

Example
    Explanation 1:
        The Given string is "abccbc".
        Remove the first occurrence of consecutive identical pairs of characters "cc".
        After removing the string will be "abbc".
        Again Removing the first occurrence of consecutive identical pairs of characters "bb".
        After removing, the string will be "ac".

        Now, there is no consecutive identical pairs of characters.
        Therefore, the string after this operation will be "ac".
    Explanation 2:
         No removals are to be done.
