Problem Description
    Given a linked list A and a value B, partition it such that all nodes less than B come before nodes greater
    than or equal to B.
    You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= |A| <= 10^6
    1 <= A[i], B <= 10^9

Input Format
    The first argument of input contains a pointer to the head to the given linked list.
    The second argument of input contains an integer, B.

Output Format
    Return a pointer to the head of the modified linked list.

Example Input
Input 1:
    A = [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2]
    B = 3
Input 2:
    A = [1, 2, 3, 1, 3]
    B = 2

Example Output
Output 1:
    [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 5]
Output 2:
    [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         [1, 2, 2] are less than B whereas [4, 3, 5] are greater than or equal to B.
    Explanation 2:
         [1, 1] are less than B whereas [2, 3, 3] are greater than or equal to B.
