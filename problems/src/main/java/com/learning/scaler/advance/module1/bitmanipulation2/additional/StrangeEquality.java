Problem Description
    Given an integer A.
    Two numbers, X and Y, are defined as follows:

    X is the greatest number smaller than A such that the XOR sum of X and A is the same as the sum of X and A.
    Y is the smallest number greater than A, such that the XOR sum of Y and A is the same as the sum of Y and A.
    Find and return the XOR of X and Y.

    NOTE 1: XOR of X and Y is defined as X ^ Y where '^' is the BITWISE XOR operator.
    NOTE 2: Your code will be run against a maximum of 100000 Test Cases.


Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 10^9

Input Format
    First and only argument is an integer A.

Output Format
    Returns an integer denoting the XOR of X and Y.

Example Input
    A = 5

Example Output
    10

Example Explanation
    The value of X will be 2 and the value of Y will be 8. The XOR of 2 and 8 is 10.
