Problem Description
    Given a string A, find the rank of the string amongst its permutations sorted lexicographically.
    Note that the characters might be repeated. If the characters are repeated, we need to look at the rank in unique permutations.
    Look at the example for more details.
    NOTE:
        The answer might not fit in an integer, so return your answer % 1000003 where 1000003 is a prime number.
        String A can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters. Characters with lesser ASCII values are considered smaller, i.e., 'a' > 'Z'.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= len(A) <= 1000000

Input Format
    First argument is a string A.

Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the rank.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = "aba"
    Input 2:
         A = "bca"

Example Output
    Output 1:
         2
    Output 2:
         4
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
     The order permutations with letters 'a', 'a', and 'b' :
        aab
        aba
        baa
     So, the rank is 2.
Explanation 2:
     The order permutations with letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' :
        abc
        acb
        bac
        bca
        cab
        cba
     So, the rank is 4.
