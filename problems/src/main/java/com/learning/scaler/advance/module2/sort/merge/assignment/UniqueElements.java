Problem Description
    You are given an array A of N elements. You have to make all elements unique. To do so,
    in one step you can increase any number by one.
    Find the minimum number of steps.


Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 10^5
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Input Format
    The only argument given is an Array A, having N integers.

Output Format
    Return the minimum number of steps required to make all elements unique.

Example
    Input 1:
         A = [1, 1, 3]
    Input 2:
         A = [2, 4, 5]

Example
    Output 1:
         1
    Output 2:
         0

Example
    Explanation 1:
         We can increase the value of 1st element by 1 in 1 step and will get all unique elements. i.e [2, 1, 3].
    Explanation 2:
         All elements are distinct.
