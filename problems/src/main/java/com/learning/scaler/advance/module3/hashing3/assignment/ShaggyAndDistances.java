Problem Description
    Shaggy has an array A consisting of N elements. We call a pair of distinct indices in that array a special if elements at those indices in the array are equal.
    Shaggy wants you to find a special pair such that the distance between that pair is minimum. Distance between two indices is defined as |i-j|. If there is no special pair in the array, then return -1.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= |A| <= 10^5

Input Format
    The first and only argument is an integer array A.

Output Format
    Return one integer corresponding to the minimum possible distance between a special pair.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = [7, 1, 3, 4, 1, 7]
    Input 2:
        A = [1, 1]

Example Output
    Output 1:
         3
    Output 2:
         1
