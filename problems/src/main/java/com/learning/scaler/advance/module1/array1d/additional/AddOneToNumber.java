Problem Description
    Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).

    The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

    NOTE: Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer. For example: for this problem, the following are some good questions to ask :
        Q: Can the input have 0's before the most significant digit. Or, in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?
        A: For the purpose of this question, YES
        Q: Can the output have 0's before the most significant digit? Or, in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?
        A: For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= size of the array <= 1000000

Input Format
    First argument is an array of digits.

Output Format
    Return the array of digits after adding one.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        [1, 2, 3]

Example Output
    Output 1:
        [1, 2, 4]

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
    Given vector is [1, 2, 3].
        The returned vector should be [1, 2, 4] as 123 + 1 = 124.
