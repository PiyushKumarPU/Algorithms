Problem Description
    Given a number A, return number of ways you can draw A chords in a circle with 2 x A points such that no 2 chords intersect.
    Two ways are different if there exists a chord which is present in one way and not in other.
    Return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 10^3

Input Format
    The first and the only argument contains the integer A.

Output Format
    Return an integer answering the query as described in the problem statement.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = 1
    Input 2:
        A = 2

Example Output
    Output 1:
        1
    Output 2:
        2


Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        If points are numbered 1 to 2 in clockwise direction, then different ways to draw chords are: {(1-2)} only. So, we return 1.
    Explanation 2:
        If points are numbered 1 to 4 in clockwise direction, then different ways to draw chords are:{(1-2), (3-4)} and {(1-4), (2-3)}.
     So, we return 2.
