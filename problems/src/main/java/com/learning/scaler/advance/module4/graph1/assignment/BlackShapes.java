Problem Description
    Given character matrix A of dimensions NÃ—M consisting of O's and X's, where O = white, X = black.
    Return the number of black shapes. A black shape consists of one or more adjacent X's (diagonals not included)

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N, M <= 1000
    A[i][j] = 'X' or 'O'


Input Format
    The First and only argument is character matrix A.

Output Format
    Return a single integer denoting number of black shapes.

Example Input
    Input 1:
     A = [ [X, X, X], [X, X, X], [X, X, X] ]
    Input 2:
     A = [ [X, O], [O, X] ]

Example Output
    Output 1:
     1
    Output 2:
     2

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
     All X's belong to single shapes
    Explanation 2:
     Both X's belong to different shapes
