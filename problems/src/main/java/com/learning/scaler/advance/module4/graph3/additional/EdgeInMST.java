Problem Description
    Given a undirected weighted graph with A nodes labelled from 1 to A with M edges given in a form of 2D-matrix B of size M * 3 where B[i][0] and B[i][1] denotes the two nodes connected by an edge of weight B[i][2].
    For each edge check whether it belongs to any of the possible minimum spanning tree or not , return 1 if it belongs else return 0.
    Return an one-dimensional binary array of size M denoting answer for each edge.
    NOTE:
        The graph may be disconnected in that case consider mst for each component.
        No self-loops and no multiple edges present.
        Answers in output array must be in order with the input array B output[i] must denote the answer of edge B[i][0] to B[i][1].

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A, M <= 3*10^5
    1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A
    1 <= B[i][1] <= 10^3

Input Format
    The first argument given is an integer A representing the number of nodes in the graph.
    The second argument given is an matrix B of size M x 3 which represents the M edges such that there is a edge between node B[i][0] and node B[i][1] with weight B[i][2].

Output Format
    Return an one-dimensional binary array of size M denoting answer for each edge.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = 3
         B = [ [1, 2, 2]
               [1, 3, 2]
               [2, 3, 3]
             ]
Example Output
    Output 1:
         [1, 1, 0]

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Edge (1, 2) with weight 2 is included in the MST           1
                                                          /   \
                                                         2     3
 Edge (1, 3) with weight 2 is included in the same MST mentioned above.
 Edge (2,3) with weight 3 cannot be included in any of the mst possible.
 So we will return [1, 1, 0]
