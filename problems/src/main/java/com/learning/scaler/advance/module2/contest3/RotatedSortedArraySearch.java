Problem Description
    Given a sorted array of integers A of size N and an integer B,
    where array A is rotated at some pivot unknown beforehand.
    For example, the array [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] might become [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2].
    Your task is to search for the target value B in the array.
    If found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.
    You can assume that no duplicates exist in the array.NOTE: You are expected to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(log(N)).

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 1000000
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
    All elements in A are Distinct.
Input Format
    The First argument given is the integer array A.The Second argument given is the integer B.
Output Format
    Return index of B in array A, otherwise return -1
Example Input
    Input 1:
    A = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]
    B = 4
    Input 2:
    A : [ 9, 10, 3, 5, 6, 8 ]
    B : 5
Example Output
    Output 1:
    0
    Output 2:
    3
Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
    Target 4 is found at index 0 in A.
    Explanation 2:
    Target 5 is found at index 3 in A.
