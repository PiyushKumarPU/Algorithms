Problem Description
    Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one, which occurs once.
    Find that element that does not appear thrice.
    NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.
    Could you implement it without using extra memory?


Problem Constraints
    2 <= A <= 5*10^6
    0 <= A <= INTMAX

Input Format
    First and only argument of input contains an integer array A.

Output Format
     Returns a single integer.

Example
    Input 1:
         A = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
    Input 2:
         A = [0, 0, 0, 1]

Example
    Output 1:
         4
    Output 2:
         1

Example
    Explanation 1:
         4 occurs exactly once in Input 1.
    Explanation 2:
         1 occurs exactly once in Input 2.
