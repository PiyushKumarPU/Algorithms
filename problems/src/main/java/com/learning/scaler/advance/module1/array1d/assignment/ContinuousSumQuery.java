Problem Description
    There are A beggars sitting in a row outside a temple. Each beggar initially has an empty pot.
    When the devotees come to the temple, they donate some amount of coins to these beggars.
    Each devotee gives a fixed amount of coin(according to their faith and ability) to some K beggars sitting next to
    each other.

    Given the amount P donated by each devotee to the beggars ranging from L to R index, where 1 <= L <= R <= A,
    find out the final amount of money in each beggar's pot at the end of the day,
    provided they don't fill their pots by any other means.
    For ith devotee B[i][0] = L, B[i][1] = R, B[i][2] = P, given by the 2D array B


Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 2 * 10^5
    1 <= L <= R <= A
    1 <= P <= 10^3
    0 <= len(B) <= 10^5

Input Format
    The first argument is a single integer A.
    The second argument is a 2D integer array B.

Output Format
    Return an array(0 based indexing) that stores the total number of coins in each beggars pot.

Example Input
    Input 1:-
        A = 5
        B = [[1, 2, 10], [2, 3, 20], [2, 5, 25]]

Example Output
    Output 1:-
        10 55 45 25 25

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:-
    First devotee donated 10 coins to beggars ranging from 1 to 2.
        Final amount in each beggars pot after first devotee: [10, 10, 0, 0, 0]
    Second devotee donated 20 coins to beggars ranging from 2 to 3.
        Final amount in each beggars pot after second devotee: [10, 30, 20, 0, 0]
    Third devotee donated 25 coins to beggars ranging from 2 to 5.
        Final amount in each beggars pot after third devotee: [10, 55, 45, 25, 25]
