Problem Description
    Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
    Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
    Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
    NOTE: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 500
    1 <= C, B[i] <= 10^6
    1 <= A[i] <= 50

Input Format
    First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
    Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
    Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.

Output Format
    Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this
    subset is smaller than or equal to C.

Example Input
    Input 1:
     A = [6, 10, 12]
     B = [10, 20, 30]
     C = 50
    Input 2:
     A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
     B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
     C = 10

Example Output
    Output 1:
     22
    Output 2:
     0

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 10 + 12 = 22
    Explanation 2:
         Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack
         therefore answer is 0.
