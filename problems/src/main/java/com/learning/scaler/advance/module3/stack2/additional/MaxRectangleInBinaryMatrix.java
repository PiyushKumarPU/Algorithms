Problem Description
    Given a 2-D binary matrix A of size N x M filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing
    only ones and return its area.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N, M <= 100

Input Format
    The first argument is a 2-D binary array A.

Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the area of the largest rectangle containing only ones.

Example
    Input 1:
         A = [
               [1, 1, 1]
               [0, 1, 1]
               [1, 0, 0]
             ]
    Input 2:
         A = [
               [0, 1, 0]
               [1, 1, 1]
             ]

Example
    Output 1:
         4
    Output 2:
         3

Example
    Explanation 1:
         As the max area rectangle is created by the 2x2 rectangle created by (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1) and (1, 2).
    Explanation 2:
         As the max area rectangle is created by the 1x3 rectangle created by (1, 0), (1, 1) and (1, 2).
