Problem Description
    You are given two integers A and B.
    Set the A-th bit and B-th bit in 0, and return output in decimal Number System.
    Note:
        The bit positions are 0-indexed, which means that the least significant bit (LSB) has index 0.

Problem Constraints
    0 <= A <= 30
    0 <= B <= 30

Input Format
    First argument A is an integer.
    Second argument B is an integer.

Output Format
    Return an integer.

Example
    Input 1:
        A = 3
        B = 5
    Input 2:
        A = 4
        B = 4

Example
    Output 1:
        40
    Output 2:
        16

Example Explanation
    For Input 1:
        The binary expression is 101000 which is 40 in decimal.
    For Input 2:
        The binary expression is 10000 which is 16 in decimal
