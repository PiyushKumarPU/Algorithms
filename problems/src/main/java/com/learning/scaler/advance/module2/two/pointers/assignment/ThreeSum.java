Problem Description
    Given an array A of N integers, find three integers in A such that the sum is closest to a given number B.
    Return the sum of those three integers.
    Assume that there will only be one solution.

Problem Constraints
    -10^8 <= B <= 10^8
    1 <= N <= 10^4
    -10^8 <= A[i] <= 10^8

Input Format
    First argument is an integer array A of size N.
    Second argument is an integer B denoting the sum you need to get close to.

Output Format
    Return a single integer denoting the sum of three integers which is closest to B.

Example
    Input 1:
        A = [-1, 2, 1, -4]
        B = 1
    Input 2:
        A = [1, 2, 3]
        B = 6

Example
    Output 1:
        2
    Output 2:
        6

Example
    Explanation 1:
         The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
    Explanation 2:
         Take all elements to get exactly 6.
