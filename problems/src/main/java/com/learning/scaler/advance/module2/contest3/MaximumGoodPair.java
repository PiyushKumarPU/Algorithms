Problem Description
    You are given 2 string arrays A and B of length N and M respectively. Both of them are in
    dictionary order(sorted lexicographically).For any pair (i, j)
    where i is an index of A and j is an index of B,
    the pair is good if i <= j and A[i] >= B[j] (lexicographically).
    The score of the pair is defined as the absolute difference between indexes abs(i - j).
    Return the maximum possible scores out of all the good pairs. Return 0 if there are no good pairs.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N, M <= 10^5
    'a' <= A[i], B[j] <= 'z'
Input Format
    The two arguments A and B are two strings.
Output Format
    Return an integer
Example Input
    Input 1:
    A = "bcc"B = "abc"
    Input 2:
    A = "add"B = "abcd"
Example Output
    Output 1:
    1
    Output 2:
    2
Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
    The good pairs are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3) and (3, 3).
    Explanation 2:
    The good pairs are (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3) and (3, 4).
