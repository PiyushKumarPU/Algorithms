Problem Description
    Given a binary search tree.
    Return the distance between two nodes with given two keys B and C. It may be assumed that both keys exist in BST.
    NOTE: Distance between two nodes is number of edges between them.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= Number of nodes in binary tree <= 1000000
    0 <= node values <= 10^9

Input Format
    First argument is a root node of the binary tree, A.
    Second argument is an integer B.
    Third argument is an integer C.

Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the distance between two nodes with given two keys B and C

Example
    Input 1:
             5
           /   \
          2     8
         / \   / \
        1   4 6   11
     B = 2
     C = 11
    Input 2:
             6
           /   \
          2     9
         / \   / \
        1   4 7   10
     B = 2
     C = 6

Example
    Output 1:
         3
    Output 2:
         1

Example
    Explanation 1:
         Path between 2 and 11 is: 2 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11. Distance will be 3.
    Explanation 2:
         Path between 2 and 6 is: 2 -> 6. Distance will be 1
