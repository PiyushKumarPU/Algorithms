Problem Description
    Given a rod of length N units and an array A of size N denotes prices that contains prices of all
    pieces of size 1 to N.
    Find and return the maximum value that can be obtained by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 1000
    0 <= A[i] <= 10^6

Input Format
    First and only argument is an integer array A of size N.

Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the maximum value that can be obtained by cutting up
    the rod and selling the pieces.

Example Input
    Input 1:
     A = [3, 4, 1, 6, 2]
    Input 2:
     A = [1, 5, 2, 5, 6]

Example Output
    Output 1:
        15
    Output 2:
        11

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         Cut the rod of length 5 into 5 rods of length (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and sell them for (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 15.
    Explanation 2:
         Cut the rod of length 5 into 3 rods of length (2, 2, 1) and sell them for (5 + 5 + 1) = 11.
