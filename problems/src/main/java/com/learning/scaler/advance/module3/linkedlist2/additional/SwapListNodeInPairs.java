Problem Description
    Given a linked list A, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
    NOTE: Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list; only nodes themselves can be changed.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= |A| <= 10^6

Input Format
    The first and the only argument of input contains a pointer to the head of the given linked list.

Output Format
    Return a pointer to the head of the modified linked list.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
    Input 2:
        A = 7 -> 2 -> 1

Example Output
    Output 1:
        2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
    Output 2:
        2 -> 7 -> 1

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        In the first example (1, 2) and (3, 4) are the adjacent nodes. Swapping them will result in 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
    Explanation 2:
        In the second example, 3rd element i.e. 1 does not have an adjacent node, so it won't be swapped.
