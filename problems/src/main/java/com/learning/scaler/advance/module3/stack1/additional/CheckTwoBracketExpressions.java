Problem Description
    Given two strings A and B. Each string represents an expression consisting of lowercase English alphabets,
     '+', '-', '(' and ')'.
    The task is to compare them and check if they are similar. If they are identical, return 1 else, return 0.
    NOTE: It may be assumed that there are at most 26 operands from ‘a’ to ‘z’, and every operand appears only once.


Problem Constraints
    1 <= length of the String <= 100

Input Format
    The given arguments are string A and string B.

Output Format
    Return 1 if they represent the same expression else return 0.

Example
    Input 1:
         A = "-(a+b+c)"
        B = "-a-b-c"
    Input 2:
         A = "a-b-(c-d)"
         B = "a-b-c-d"

Example
    Output 1:
         1
    Output 2:
         0

Example
    Explanation 1:
         The expression "-(a+b+c)" can be written as "-a-b-c" which is equal as B.
    Explanation 2:
         Both the expression are different.
