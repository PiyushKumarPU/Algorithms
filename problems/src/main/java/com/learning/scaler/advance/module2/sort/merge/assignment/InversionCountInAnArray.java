Problem Description
    Given an array of integers A. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A.
    Find the total number of inversions of A modulo (109 + 7).

Problem Constraints
    1 <= length of the array <= 10^5
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Input Format
    The only argument given is the integer array A.

Output Format
    Return the number of inversions of A modulo (109 + 7).

Example
    Input 1:
        A = [1, 3, 2]
    Input 2:
        A = [3, 4, 1, 2]

Example
    Output 1:
        1
    Output 2:
        4

Example
    Explanation 1:
        The pair (1, 2) is an inversion as 1 < 2 and A[1] > A[2]
    Explanation 2:
        The pair (0, 2) is an inversion as 0 < 2 and A[0] > A[2]
        The pair (0, 3) is an inversion as 0 < 3 and A[0] > A[3]
        The pair (1, 2) is an inversion as 1 < 2 and A[1] > A[2]
        The pair (1, 3) is an inversion as 1 < 3 and A[1] > A[3]
