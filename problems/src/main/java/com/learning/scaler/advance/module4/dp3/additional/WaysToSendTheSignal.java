Problem Description
    You are trying to send signals to aliens using a linear array of A laser lights.
    You don't know much about how the aliens are going to percieve the signals, but what you know is that
    if two consecutive lights are on then the aliens might take it as a sign of danger and destroy the earth.
    Find and return the total number of ways in which you can send a signal without compromising the
    safety of the earth.

    Return the ans % 10^9 + 7.


Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 10^5

Input Format
    The only argument given is integer A.

Output Format
    Return the ans%(10^9+7).

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = 2
    Input 2:
        A = 3

Example Output
    Output 1:
        3
    Output 2:
        5

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         OFF OFF
         OFF ON
         ON OFF
        All lights off is also a valid signal which probably means 'bye'
    Explanation 2:
         OFF OFF OFF
         OFF OFF ON
         OFF ON OFF
         ON OFF OFF
         ON OFF ON
