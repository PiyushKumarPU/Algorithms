Problem Description:
    You are given two positive numbers A and B .
    You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:

       1.  X divides A i.e. A % X = 0
       2. X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A, B <= 10^9

Input Format
    First argument is an integer A.
    Second argument is an integer B.

Output Format
    Return an integer maximum value of X as described above.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = 30
         B = 12
    Input 2:
         A = 5
         B = 10

Example Output
    Output 1:
         5
    Output 2:
         1

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        All divisors of A are (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30).
        The maximum value is 5 such that A%5 == 0 and gcd(5,12) = 1
    Explanation 2:
        1 is the only value such that A%5 == 0 and gcd(1,10) = 1
