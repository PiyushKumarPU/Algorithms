Problem Description
    Given an array A of N integers. Sort the array in increasing order of the value at the tens place
    digit of every number.

    If a number has no tens digit, we can assume value to be 0.
    If 2 numbers have same tens digit, in that case number with max value will come first
    Solution should be based on comparator.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 10^5
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Input Format
    First argument A is an array of integers.

Output Format
    Return the array after sorting

Example Input
    Input 1:
    A = [15, 11, 7, 19]
    Input 2:
    A = [2, 24, 22, 19]

Example Output
    Output 1:
    [7, 19, 15, 11]
    Output 2:
    [2, 19, 24, 22]

Example Explanation
    For Input 1:
    The sorted order is [7, 19, 15, 11]. The tens digit of 7 is 0,
    and that of 19, 15 and 11 is 1.
    For Input 2:
    The sorted order is [2, 19, 24, 22]. The tens digit of 2 is 0,
    that of 19 is 1 and that of 22 and 24 is 2.
