Problem Description
    Given an integer array A of size N. You have to delete one element such that the GCD(Greatest common divisor)
    of the remaining array is maximum.
    Find the maximum value of GCD.

Problem Constraints
    2 <= N <= 10^5
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Input Format
    First argument is an integer array A.

Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the maximum value of GCD.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = [12, 15, 18]
    Input 2:
        A = [5, 15, 30]

Example Output
    Output 1:
        6
    Output 2:
        15

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        If you delete 12, gcd will be 3.
        If you delete 15, gcd will be 6.
        If you delete 18, gcd will 3.
        Maximum value of gcd is 6.
    Explanation 2:
        If you delete 5, gcd will be 15.
        If you delete 15, gcd will be 5.
        If you delete 30, gcd will be 5.
        Maximum value of gcd is 15.
