Problem Description
    Given an array A of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
    Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= len(A) <= 100000
    0 <= A[i] <= 2*109

Input Format
    The first argument is an array of integers.

Output Format
    Return a string representing the largest number.

Example Input
    Input 1:
    A = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
    Input 2:
    A = [2, 3, 9, 0]

Example Explanation
    For Input 1:
    The number 9 has 3 factors, 6 has 4 factors and 8 has 4 factors.
    For Input 2:
    The number 2 has 2 factors, 7 has 2 factors and 4 has 3 factors.
