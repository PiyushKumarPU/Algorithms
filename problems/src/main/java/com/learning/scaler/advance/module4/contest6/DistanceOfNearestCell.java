        Problem Description

 Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M consisting of 0 or 1.

For each cell of the matrix find the distance of nearest 1 in the matrix.

Distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is defined as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Find and return a matrix B of size N x M which defines for each cell in A distance of nearest 1 in the matrix A.

NOTE: There is atleast one 1 is present in the matrix.

Problem Constraints

 1 <= N, M <= 1000

0 <= A[i][j] <= 1

Input Format

 The first argument given is the integer matrix A.

Output Format

 Return the matrix B.

Example Input

 Input 1:

 A = [

       [0, 0, 0, 1]

       [0, 0, 1, 1]

       [0, 1, 1, 0]

     ]

Input 2:

 A = [

       [1, 0, 0]

       [0, 0, 0]

       [0, 0, 0]

     ]

Example Output

 Output 1:

 [

   [3, 2, 1, 0]

   [2, 1, 0, 0]

   [1, 0, 0, 1]

 ]

Output 2:

 [

   [0, 1, 2]

   [1, 2, 3]

   [2, 3, 4]

 ]

Example Explanation

 Explanation 1:

 A[0][0], A[0][1], A[0][2] will be nearest to A[0][3].

 A[1][0], A[1][1] will be nearest to A[1][2].

 A[2][0] will be nearest to A[2][1] and A[2][3] will be nearest to A[2][2].

Explanation 2:

 There is only a single 1. Fill the distance from that 1.
