Problem Description
    You are given a linked list that contains a loop.
    You need to find the node, which creates a loop and break it by making the node point to NULL.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= number of nodes <= 1000

Input Format
    The first of the input contains a LinkedList, where the first number is the number of nodes N, and the next N nodes are the node value of the linked list.
    The second line of the input contains an integer which denotes the position of node where cycle starts.

Output Format
    return the head of the updated linked list.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        1 -> 2
        ^    |
        | - -
    Input 2:
        3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
                  ^         |
                  |         |
                  - - - - - -

Example Output
    Output 1:
        1 -> 2 -> NULL
    Output 2:
        3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        Chain of 1->2 is broken.
    Explanation 2:
        Chain of 4->6 is broken.
