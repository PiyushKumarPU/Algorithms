Problem Description
    Given an array A of length N where all the elements are distinct and are in the range [1, N+2].
    Two numbers from the range [1, N+2] are missing from the array A. Find the two missing numbers.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 10^5
    1 <= A[i] <= N+2

    The elements of array A are distinct

Input Format
    Only argument A is an array of integers

Output Format
     Returns a sorted array of size 2 denoting the missing elements.

Example
    Input 1:
        A = [3, 2, 4]
    Input 2:
        A = [5, 1, 3, 6]

Example
Output 1:
    [1, 5]
Output 2:
