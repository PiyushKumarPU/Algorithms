Problem Description
    Find largest distance Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes.
    The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree. Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree).
    The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.
    The tree is given as an array A, there is an edge between nodes A[i] and i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the i's will have A[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.

Problem Constraints
    2 <= |A| <= 40000

Input Format
    First and only argument is vector A

Output Format
    Return the length of the longest path

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = [-1, 0]
    Input 2:
        A = [-1, 0, 0]

Example Output
    Output 1:
         1
    Output 2:
         2

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         Path is 0 -> 1.
    Explanation 2:
         Path is 1 -> 0 -> 2.
