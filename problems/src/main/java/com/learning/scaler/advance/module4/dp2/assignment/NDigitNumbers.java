Problem Description
    Find out the number of A digit positive numbers, whose digits on being added equals to a given number B.
    Note that a valid number starts from digits 1-9 except the number 0 itself. i.e. leading zeroes are not allowed.
    Since the answer can be large, output answer modulo 1000000007

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 1000
    1 <= B <= 10000

Input Format
    First argument is the integer A
    Second argument is the integer B

Output Format
    Return a single integer, the answer to the problem

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = 2
        B = 4
    Input 2:
        A = 1
        B = 3


Example Output
    Output 1:
        4
    Output 2:
        1

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        Valid numbers are {22, 31, 13, 40}
        Hence output 4.
    Explanation 2:
        Only valid number is 3
