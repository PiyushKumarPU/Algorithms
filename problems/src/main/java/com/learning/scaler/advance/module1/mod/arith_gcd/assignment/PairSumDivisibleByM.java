Problem Description
    Given an array of integers A and an integer B,
    find and return the number of pairs in A whose sum is divisible by B.

    Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo (10^9 + 7).
    Note: Ensure to handle integer overflow when performing the calculations.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= length of the array <= 100000
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
    1 <= B <= 10^6

Input Format
    The first argument given is the integer array A.
    The second argument given is the integer B.

Output Format
    Return the total number of pairs for which the sum is divisible by B modulo (109 + 7).

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        B = 2
    Input 2:
        A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
        B = 28

Example Output
    Output 1:
        4
    Output 2:
        1

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
     All pairs which are divisible by 2 are (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (3,5).
     So total 4 pairs.
    Explanation 2:
     There is only one pair which is divisible by 28 is (17, 11)
