Problem Description
    Given an integer array A of size N. You can remove any element from the array in one operation.
    The cost of this operation is the sum of all elements in the array present before this operation.
    Find the minimum cost to remove all elements from the array.

Problem Constraints
    0 <= N <= 1000
    1 <= A[i] <= 10^3

Input Format
    First and only argument is an integer array A.

Output Format
    Return an integer denoting the total cost of removing all elements from the array.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = [2, 1]
    Input 2:
         A = [5]

Example Output
    Output 1:
         4
    Output 2:
         5

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         Given array A = [2, 1]
         Remove 2 from the array => [1]. Cost of this operation is (2 + 1) = 3.
         Remove 1 from the array => []. Cost of this operation is (1) = 1.
         So, total cost is = 3 + 1 = 4.
    Explanation 2:
         There is only one element in the array. So, cost of removing is 5.
