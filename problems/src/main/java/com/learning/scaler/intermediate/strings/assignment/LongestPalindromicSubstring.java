Problem Description
    Given a string A of size N, find and return the longest palindromic substring in A.
    Substring of string A is A[i...j] where 0 <= i <= j < len(A)

Palindrome string:
    A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, A is palindrome if reverse(A) = A.
    Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 6000

Input Format
    First and only argument is a string A.

Output Format
    Return a string denoting the longest palindromic substring of string A.

Example Input
    Input 1:
        A = "aaaabaaa"
    Input 2:
        A = "abba

Example Output
    Output 1:
        "aaabaaa"
    Output 2:
        "abba"

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        We can see that longest palindromic substring is of length 7 and the string is "aaabaaa".
    Explanation 2:
        We can see that longest palindromic substring is of length 4 and the string is "abba".
