Problem Description
    You are given a string A of size N.
    Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.
NOTE:
    A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
    Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
    If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 3 * 10^5

Input Format
    The only argument given is string A.

Output Format
    Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

Example Input
Input 1:
    A = "the sky is blue"
Input 2:
    A = "this is ib"

Example Output
    Output 1:
        "blue is sky the"
    Output 2:
        "ib is this"

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
        We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "blue is sky the".
    Explanation 2:
        We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "ib is this".
