Problem Description
    Given an integer array A of size N. Return 1 if the array can be arranged to form an arithmetic progression,
     otherwise return 0.
    A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between
    any two consecutive elements is the same.

Problem Constraints
    2 <= N <= 10^5
    -10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Input Format
    The first and only argument is an integer array A of size N.

Output Format
    Return 1 if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise return 0.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = [3, 5, 1]
    Input 2:
         A = [2, 4, 1]

Example Output
    Output 1:
         1
    Output 2:
         0

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         We can reorder the elements as [1, 3, 5] or [5, 3, 1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively,
         between each consecutive elements.
    Explanation 2:
         There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
