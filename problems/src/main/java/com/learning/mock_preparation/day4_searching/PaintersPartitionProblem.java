Problem Description
    Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
    You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B
    units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
    Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will
    only paint contiguous sections of the board.
    NOTE:
    1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter,
    and partially by another.
    2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3
    but not 2 is invalid.

    Return the ans % 10000003.

Problem Constraints
    1 <= A <= 1000
    1 <= B <= 10^6
    1 <= N <= 10^5
    1 <= C[i] <= 10^6

Input Format
    The first argument given is the integer A.
    The second argument given is the integer B.
    The third argument given is the integer array C.

Output Format
    Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint
    contiguous sections of board % 10000003.

Example Input
    Input 1:
         A = 2
         B = 5
         C = [1, 10]
    Input 2:
         A = 10
         B = 1
         C = [1, 8, 11, 3]

Example Output
    Output 1:
         50
    Output 2:
         11

Example Explanation
    Explanation 1:
         Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
         Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
         There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
         ans = 50 % 10000003
    Explanation 2:
         Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3
         and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
         ans = 11 % 10000003
