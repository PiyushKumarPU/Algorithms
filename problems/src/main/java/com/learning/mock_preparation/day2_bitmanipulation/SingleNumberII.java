Problem Description
Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one, which occurs once.

Find that element that does not appear thrice.

NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.

Could you implement it without using extra memory?




Problem Constraints
2 <= A <= 5*106

0 <= A <= INTMAX



Input Format
First and only argument of input contains an integer array A.



Output Format
Return a single integer.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [0, 0, 0, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 4 occurs exactly once in Input 1.
 1 occurs exactly once in Input 2.
